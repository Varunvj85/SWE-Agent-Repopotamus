# SWE-Agent-Repopotamus
I built an LLM-based agentic workflow to generate code patches for reported bugs in various public Github repositories. These bugs were taken from the SWE-bench Lite dataset and include well-known repositories like django, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc. The patches generated by our model were unit tested by the raw, inbuilt SWE-bench evaluator.
